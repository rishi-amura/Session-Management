# Session Management
* Need an application to manage sessions. 
* There will be multiple users registered in th system. 
* You will need to store session information(eg. Who is the speaker, who are attending this session, date and time of session, title description etc.). 
* There will be links to create, update, delete and index all users. Similar for Sessions. 
* You need to have a link to view all sessions user has given. 
* You can allow sorting on date or name etc.
